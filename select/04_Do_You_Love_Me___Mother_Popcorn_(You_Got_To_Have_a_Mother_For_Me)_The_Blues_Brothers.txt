You broke my heart 'cause i couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
But now i'm back
To show you i can really shake 'em down
Do you love me (i can really move)
Do you love me (i'm in the groove)
Do you love me (do you love me)
Now that i can dance
Watch me now

(Work, work) now work it out baby
(Work, work) oh, you're driving me crazy
(Work, work) with a little bit of soul now

Well i can mash potato (i can mash potato)
I can do the twist (i can do the twist)
Well do the funky funky chicken (do the funky funky chicken)
Well do you like it like this (do you like it like this)
Tell me (tell me)
Tell me

Do you love me (i can really move)
Do you love me (i'm in the groove)
Do you love me (do you love me)
Now that i can dance
Watch me now

Do you love me (i can really move)
Do you love me baby (i'm in the groove)
Do you love me (do you love me)
Now that i can dance
Watch me now

(Work, work) now work it out baby
(Work, work) i'm gonna drive you crazy
(Work, work) shake it up shake it up now(br>
Now do you love me (i can really move)
Do you love me (i'm in the groove)
