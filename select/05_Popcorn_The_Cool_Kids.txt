Chuck Inglish:
Im hot as popcorn steam in the bag when it pops
Mailbox on your porch deliver mail to your spot
Door bells door knocks open up its the cops
Sike all the cool kids came to jump on your couch
Now im cleaner than detergent
Not clothes took a shower with the jergens, cool water cologne
Wait a minute baby call me on my phone
Said you got the voicemail? oh cause it's not on
Let me switch it now take these seven digits, dig it
Playin kick ball later baby come kick it
Jump on my team all tees to the fences
Nah i can't ride you on my bike we gotta whip it
4 by 4 GMC jeeps fords broncos and the... trunk
Calf lift drop call me chuck mini-truck
Deep dish fat boys stick out like a thumb
In that mustang Caine drove bumpin Computer Love
Chorus
It's like click click twitch hands
Twist this peter pan
Me and chuck biscuits chillin in the pan man
Blaow! here's one for your mouth
It's the Cool Kids and we here to jump on your couch
Click click twist hands
Me and chuck biscuits chillin in the pan man
Blaow! we outside of your house
It's the Cool Kids and we here to jump on your couch
Mikey Rocks:
Man I told a rhino that I'm tryna write a book bout
How to get vagina when you hangin at the cook out
Something to that effect better yet a get it check
Bowls in the ca-bin-et spoons in the room with the sink
Fork knives I can get you a link
They eatin all the jerk chicken like it's goin extinct
I'm in the kitchen while you bitchin niggas chillin what you grillin for?
Try to stop the party you'll be kicked from the windows wall
Cielin floor shit for brains get the door
If it rains let it pour, what you think they made umbrellas for
Forrest Gump runnin to a Bubba shrimp luncheon
To jump off the cliff from the beginning like the lemmings
Late night Peter Jennings Here reporting live from the Barbecue
And it looks like they're escorting guys to the back
Two black males wearing sporting cap
Just got word its the Cool Kids
Church like the pulpit
Chorus
