Hey you all look out let a man come in
I got to have fun I'm gonna do my thing
Way over yonder can you dig that mess
The sister standing out there dressed up
In a brand new mini dress
Look hey over there
Do you see that boy playing that horn
And dig that soul brother look at him doing the popcorn

Hey everybody I got a brand new start
Hey, hey everybody I got a brand new start
I ain't gonna hurt nobody
I just, I just I just wanna help my heart
Gonna have a ball sure as you're born
Gonna have a ball sure as you're born
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance do the popcorn

Hey look a there hey look a there
Do you see what I see
Everybody doing the popcorn but me
Get back over there with your mini dress
Look out good mama I gotta do my best
Hey over there hey over there look a here
A look a here I got the best band in the land
I just gotta jump back take my stand
I want to ask the fellows don't have no doubt
I just got to lay to lay it right out
