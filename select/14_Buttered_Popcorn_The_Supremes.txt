My baby likes
(Buttered popcorn, buttered popcorn, buttered popcorn)
Oh yeah, caught me, likes it greasy
(Buttered popcorn, buttered popcorn)
And salty and gooey and sticky
(Buttered popcorn, buttered popcorn, buttered popcorn)

I said, "What do you like?"
He says, "You know what I like
I like buttered popcorn"

He took me to the show
(Buttered, buttered, buttered popcorn)
He said, "He wanted some more"
(Buttered, buttered, buttered popcorn)

I said, "Kiss me please"
(Buttered, buttered, buttered popcorn)
He said, "After I eat"
(Buttered, buttered, buttered popcorn)

I said, "What do you like?"
He says, "You know what I like
I like buttered popcorn"

For breakfast, lunch and a dinner too
He eats
(Buttered popcorn, buttered popcorn)
And it worries me so, I don't know what to do
(Buttered popcorn, buttered popcorn)

And I asked him, "What was happenin' in the world today?"
He said, "More butter, more butter, more butter, more"
